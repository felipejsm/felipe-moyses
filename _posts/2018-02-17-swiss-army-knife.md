Hi!   
Every now and then it's possible to read/hear the following quote:    
> A good programmer it's a lazy person     
![lazy morning](../images/post_3/lazy.jpeg)

You might agree with it or not but it's factual that if you have the oportunity to avoid a repetitive task, well... you will!    
And I'm creating a repository at github with the intention to do exactly that.    

## How? You may ask

Bye.
