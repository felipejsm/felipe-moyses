> A good programmer it's a lazy person        
 
Every now and then it's possible to read/hear the aforementioned phrase

You might agree with it or not but it's factual that if you have the opportunity to avoid a repetitive task, well... you will do it!    
And I'm creating a repository at my github account with the intention to do exactly that.    

## How it will work? You may ask      

First, here it is the [repo](https://github.com/felipejsm/java-utils)    

### The Structure   
I'll put the task/problem in the _Table of Content_ section.      
Create a short description of what's the task is about in the README.md,     
alongside with a series of links that will be usefull for me.    
Finally, create the folder and start coding.

### Techs and related stuff     
It will vary but I believe it'll be like as following:    
- Spring and it's environment;     
- Java EE 7;      
- TDD;     
- JUnit;     
- Java 8/9;      
- MySQL/Mongo/H2/SQLServer;     
- AngularJS and (maybe) Angular 5;     
- Bootstrap 4;        
- Lubuntu 17.10.      

### That's all folks     
As a start, I guess I'll be alright sticking with my plan.     
After the completion of each task, I'll do a post with the tag _util_      
Doing so, I believe I will help myself in the future and, even better, someone else too.
