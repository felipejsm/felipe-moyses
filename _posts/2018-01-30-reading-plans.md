Hi!   
As my first post in this blog I thought it would be nice to be something more _casual_ as per se      
So... When I was younger I was a bookworm    
Yet, I've lost the _"touch"_ of it   
I really want to get it back, so for that reason, I've settled a goal:   
I will read 12 books(non-tech) on this year of 2018.    

My 2018 book's to read list is as follow:

- #1 - The Stand
![The Stand](http://bit.ly/2EjCVog)
**Author** Stephen King
**Status** Read     

- [and then there was none](http://bit.ly/2ntCXPJ) by Agatha Christie - Read
- [The Castle](http://bit.ly/1EzPGGD) by Franz Kafka - Reading
