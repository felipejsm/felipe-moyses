Hi!   
As my first post in this blog I thought it would be nice to be something more _casual_ as per se      
So... When I was younger I was a bookworm    
Yet, I've lost the _"touch"_ of it   
I really want to get it back, so for that reason, I've settled a goal:   
I will read 12 books(non-tech) on this year of 2018.    

My 2018 book's to read list is as follow:

## #1 - The Stand
![The Stand](http://bit.ly/2E34raf)    
**Author** Stephen King
**Status** _Read_     

## #2 - And Then There Was None     
![and then there was none](http://bit.ly/2j1HV2I)     
**Author** Agatha Christie      
**Status** _Read_  

## #3 - The Castle

**Author** Franz Kafka           
**Status** _Reading_
