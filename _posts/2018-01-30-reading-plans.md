Hi!   
As my first post in this blog I thought it would be nice to be something more _casual_ as per se      
So... When I was younger I was a bookworm    
Yet, I've lost the _"touch"_ of it   
I really want to get it back, so for that reason, I've settled a goal:   
I will read 12 books(non-tech) on this year of 2018.
