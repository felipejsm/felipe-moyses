In my last post, I've showed my reading plans for 2018  
It was solely non-tech books   
And now I'm gonna show off what I intend to read and why.

## #1. Java EE Development with Eclipse - Second Edition

- **Status** _reading_
- **Why?** 
I was looking for a book about Java EE 7, because I want to revisit some concepts.
I'll skip the jsp/jsf chapters because those tech aren't my _thing_ anymore.
I'm interested in EJB, Web Services and JMS(mainly), as a bonus the book give us a glimpse about memory tracking, which is something I care a lot.

## #2. Java EE 7 - The Big Picture

- **Why?**
In this one, I wanna go further into the topics I revisited in the previous book, let's say it was an introdutory one.    
In the other hand this one seems more complete and robust, it'll be good to sharpen my skills.

## #3. Head First - Design Pattern

- **Why?**
It's _sine qua non_ to have a strength design pattern knowlodge in your project. 
It saves your time and keep your code smart.

## The Big Picture
There are 2 main reasons why I'm focusing on those technologies and 1 big goal.
First one, it's really great to build enterprise applications with Java :)
Second one, those sharpened skills  that I will acquire in due time, will give me confidence as a developer and allow me to kick off my _**Not So Sexy Initiative**_.
And my goal is continue my career overseas, in Europe to be more precise.
